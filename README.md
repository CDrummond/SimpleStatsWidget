# SimpleStatsWidget
This is an android app for displaying simple count statistics on sms and calls as widget. It shows your outgoing sms and outgoing call minutes per month in an widget on your home screen or lock screen.

## Permissions
The widget doesn't show advertisements or uses more permissions than neccessary to be privacy friendly. It needs the permission to read your call log and your sms to update the count statistics. **Nothing** is being transmitted from your phone.

## How to use
After installation of the .apk (either directly from the [releases](https://github.com/Chessmasterrr/SimpleStatsWidget/releases) or via F-Droid) you will find the app in your widget screen. For most android versions you reach it with tap and hold long on the home screen and click on the widgets button. To add the widget to your screen, simply choose and drop it there.

## Settings
The widget updates itself when you click on it or by default every 60 minutes. You can simply change the size of the widget (tap and hold on the widget). On startup you can specify whether your calls should be roundet up to full minutes or not and how many characters one of your sms have (to count longer sms correctly). To change these settings later you have to remove the widget and add it again.
